## **About This Repository**
This repository contains the code and data used for survival analysis, height modeling, and plant diversity analysis in the study:

**"Long-term impacts of peat-based soil amendments promote ecological recovery in a boreal forest mine site in northern Ontario, Canada"**, published in *Restoration Ecology*.

## **Contents**
